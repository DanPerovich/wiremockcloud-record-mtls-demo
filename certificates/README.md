# Certificates Directory

This directory will contain the MTLS certificates needed for the demo. **These files are not included in the repository for security reasons.**

## Required Certificate Files

After running the certificate generation scripts, this directory should contain:

### Client Authentication (for MTLS)
- `client.crt` - Client certificate
- `client.key` - Client private key (**PRIVATE - never commit**)
- `client-combined.pem` - Combined client cert+key for WireMock CLI (**PRIVATE - never commit**)

### Certificate Authority
- `ca.crt` - Certificate Authority certificate
- `ca.key` - CA private key (**PRIVATE - never commit**)

### Server Certificates (System-Trusted)
- `server-mkcert.crt` - System-trusted server certificate (generated by mkcert)
- `server-mkcert.key` - Server private key (**PRIVATE - never commit**)

## Generating Certificates

Run one of these commands to generate the required certificates:

### Complete Setup (Recommended)
```bash
./generate-ca-and-certs.sh
```

### Individual Generation
```bash
# Generate client certificates
./generate-client-certs.sh

# Generate server certificates  
./generate-mkcert-server-certs.sh
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Private key files (`.key`, `.pem`) contain sensitive cryptographic material and should NEVER be committed to version control or shared publicly.

The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent accidental commits of certificate files.
